    <h3>DMCA Notice—Notice & Procedure For Making Claims of Copyright Infringement</h3>

    <p>{{ constant('BUSINESS_NAME', ewebify) }} policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium
        Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Copyright-infringing materials found on the Site can be identified and removed
        via our process listed below, and you agree to comply with such process in the event you are involved
        in any claim of copyright infringement to which the DMCA may be applicable.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you believe in good faith that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement,
        please provide {{ constant('BUSINESS_NAME', ewebify) }}’s copyright agent the written information specified below. Please note that this
        procedure is exclusively for notifying {{ constant('BUSINESS_NAME', ewebify) }} that your copyrighted material has been infringed. {{ constant('BUSINESS_NAME', ewebify) }}
        does not and will not make any legal decisions about the validity of your claim of infringement or the
        possible defenses to a claim. When a clear and valid notice is received pursuant to the guidelines set
        forth below, {{ constant('BUSINESS_NAME', ewebify) }} will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access
        to it. {{ constant('BUSINESS_NAME', ewebify) }} may contact the notice provider to request additional information. Under the DMCA, {{ constant('BUSINESS_NAME', ewebify) }} is
        required to take reasonable steps to notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing content ("Alleged Infringer").
    </p>

    <p>T
        he Alleged Infringer is allowed under the law to send {{ constant('BUSINESS_NAME', ewebify) }} a counter-notification. Notices and
        counter-notices are legal notices distinct from regular Site activities or communications. We may
        publish or share them with third parties in our sole discretion (in addition to producing them
        pursuant to a subpoena or other legal discovery request). Anyone making a false or fraudulent notice or
        counter-notice may be liable for damages under the DMCA, including costs and attorneys’ fees. Any person
        who is unsure of whether certain material infringes a copyright held by such person or a third party should contact an attorney.
        To file a DMCA notice, the copyright owner must send in a written letter by fax, regular mail or email only.
        We reserve the right to ignore a notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA, and we may, but are not obligated
        to, respond to a non-compliant notice.
    </p>

    <p class="dmca_notice">A DMCA notice must:</p>

    <p class="dmca_indent">
        1.	Identify specifically the copyrighted work(s) believed to have been infringed (for example, "My copyrighted work is the picture that appears at [list location, including URL, where material is located].");<br />
        2.	Identify the Content that a copyright owner claims is infringing upon copyrighted work. The copyright owner must provide information reasonably sufficient to enable us to locate the item on the Site. The copyright owner should provide clear screenshots of the allegedly infringing materials for identification purposes only. The information provided should be as detailed as possible;<br />
        3.	Provide information sufficient to permit us to contact the copyright owner directly: name, street address, telephone number and email (if available);<br />
        4.	If available, provide information sufficient to permit us to notify the Alleged Infringer (email address preferred);<br />
        5.	Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law";<br />
        6.	Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed";<br />
        7.	Be signed; and<br />
        8.	Be sent to our DMCA designated agent at the following address:
